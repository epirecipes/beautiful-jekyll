## Introduction

[Take me to the cookbook!](http://epirecip.es/epicookbook/)

This is an initiative to implement as many different epidemiological models as possible in a variety of computer languages.

Why? Reasons include:
- Replication and reproducibility are important
- Introductory textbooks give few applied examples
- There are many tips and tricks involved in epidemiological modeling in practice
- It lowers the barrier for new researchers to enter the field

More on the rationale can be found [here](http://epirecip.es/rationale/).

## The Epirecipes workshop: The Alan Turing Institute, October 1-3 2018

This is a three day meeting to bring together researchers to implement as many different epidemiological models as possible. The meeting will be held at [The Alan Turing Institute](https:/www.turing.ac.uk/), beginning Monday 1st October 2018 with registration at 09:30-10:00, and finish on Wednesday 3rd October 2018 at 17.00.

Further details on registration can be found [here](http://epirecip.es/registration/).
