## Registration: Deadline 5th September 2018

As space and funding are limited, there are a limited number of places in this workshop, for which a (brief) application is required. The link for registration is [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LZlotZPFCUDednnQ2cS2R9XnHX_qAgMved9JyVZVzAY).

## Travel bursaries

A small number of travel bursaries are available to assist in travel expenses, with priority given to early career researchers, and those from low-to-middle-income countries. Please indicate in your application whether you require a bursary to attend.
