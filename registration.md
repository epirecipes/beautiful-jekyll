## Registration

As space and funding are limited, there are a limited number of places in this workshop, for which a (brief) application is required. The link will go live soon.

## Travel bursaries

A small number of travel bursaries are available to assist in travel expenses, with priority given to early career researchers, and those from low-to-middle-income countries. Please indicate in your application whether you require a bursary to attend, and give an estimate of costs.
