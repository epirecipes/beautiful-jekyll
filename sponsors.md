## The Alan Turing Institute

The Alan Turing Institute, headquartered in the British Library, London, was created as the national institute for data science in 2015. In 2017, as a result of a government recommendation, artificial intelligence was added to their remit. The Institute is named in honour of Alan Turing (23 June 1912 â€“ 7 June 1954), whose pioneering work in theoretical and applied mathematics, engineering and computing are considered to be the key disciplines comprising the fields of data science and artificial intelligence. Five founding universities - Cambridge, Edinburgh, Oxford, UCL and Warwick - and the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council created The Alan Turing Institute in 2015. Eight new universities - Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle, Queen Mary University of London, Birmingham, Exeter, Bristol, and Southampton - joined the Institute in 2018.

## Cambridge Infectious Diseases

Cambridge Infectious Diseases is an Interdisciplinary Research Centre at Cambridge, designed to build research capacity in tackling some of today's grand challenges, whose vision is to create a world-leading interdisciplinary centre for infectious diseases research and accelerate solutions to reduce the global health burden of infectious diseases. As a virtual network, CID connects over 300 infectious diseases researchers across the University and sector leading institutes in Cambridge - with members from  biological sciences, medicine, physical sciences, social sciences, humanities, computer science and engineering. Their activities support collaboration in a variety of ways; joint ownership, partnership, coordination, information exchange, convening and consultation. We promote dialogue and knowledge transfer between infectious disease scientists of all disciplines. Amongst their infectious diseases priorities are novel and re-emerging pathogens, infectious diseases at the human-animal interface, pathogen population genetics and transmission dynamics, and antimicrobial resistance.

## Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics (CCDD) at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health

The Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics (CCDD) at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health is focused on improving methods for mathematical modeling and statistical inference on infectious disease data, engagement with policy makers to use the results of transmission dynamic studies to improve decisions, and outreach to multiple constituencies to provide education about communicable disease dynamics, tools for their analysis, and opportunities for interaction with scientists in the field.

## R Epidemics Consortium

The R Epidemics Consortium (RECON) assembles a group of international experts in infectious disease modelling, Public Health, and software development to create the next generation of tools for disease outbreak analysis using the R software. This includes packages specifically designed for handling, visualising, and analysing outbreak data using cutting-edge statistical methods, as well as more general-purpose tools for data cleaning, versioning, and encryption, and system infrastructure.

## Julia Computing

Julia Computing was founded in July 2015 by 6 co-founders - the 4 creators of the Julia programming language (Dr.Viral Shah, Prof.Alan Edelman, Dr.Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski) along with Deepak Vinchhi and Keno Fischer. Julia Computing's mission is to develop products that make Julia easy to use, easy to deploy and easy to scale.
